# Data Visualization-Titanic Dataset

## Summary
Three barcharts were used to show the total number of people who survided as per thier class, sex and average age of people survived for each class and sex. 

## Design
The Titanic dataset were downloaded from the link given in the file project. Titanic dataset which contains information for 891 people of the 2224 passangers on board of the Titanic that sank in North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April, 1912, after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.The dataset contains many missing values, before data viaualization was made some EDA was employed in python. Forexample only the ages of 714 people from 891 passanger,as age is a numerical value, the missing values was filled with the mean of the population. The visualization was designed to show  survival of passsager as per thier class, sex and also averge age survied for each class and sex. As the dataset contains many categorical varaibles such as sex and class, bar char is a suitable means to visualized the dataset and I choose dimple.js for data visualization due to its simplecity of plotting charts.


## Feedback

### Feedback 1
When clicking the tab to view your charts they over lapped one over the other , that make it messy to visualize your charts so clealy. please find a way to avoid the overlap of one chart over the other. 
### Feedback 2

You have used stacked chart to show each category in the dataset, I think one chart could be enough to show this information or you better show them on separate charts. 

### Feedback 3

The fonts on each tag is so large better you reduce the font size and also the button size for better viaulization.


## Post feedback

As per the feedbacks given above I have tried to incorborate their suggestion in the final plot, I have used  different bar cahrts to plot number of survival per class, sex and average age of survival in each calss and sex. In addition I have tried to reduce the font and the button size for better viaulization.
